# NoSQL
DESCRIPTION
I created a workout tracker, by creating a mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

USER STORY
As a user, 
I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. 
I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. 
I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. 
If the exercise is a cardio exercise, 
I should be able to track my distance traveled.
